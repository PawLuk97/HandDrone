# Quadcopter Flight Trajectory with Hand Detection and Wind Parameter Customization (HandDrone)

based on [Quad_SimCon](https://github.com/bobzwik/Quadcopter_SimCon?tab=readme-ov-file)

This repository is an extension of the Quadcopter_SimCon project. The original scripts have been modified to enhance the functionality with a hand detection feature. The new script allows the user to control the drone's flight trajectory by pointing with the index finger, specifying the trajectory points in real-time. Additionally, the scripts have been adapted to enable the selection of different trajectory types and customizable wind parameters, providing greater flexibility in simulating various flight conditions.
